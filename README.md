# qualifications-for-elected-leaders
An experiment to see if this platform can be used to determine the expectations we as a populace should have of our elected leaders

# Background

Democratic representative republics are great in theory, but the practice in the USA has led to some incredibly unqualified leaders getting to the top.
This problem has come to a head in the 2016 Presidential election with both major parties apparently set to
nominate the worst of their worst. We must not sit idly by while our government is taken over by people who have no business
leading it. Although it might be too late to change this for this cycle, I want to start now to see if we can
get a strong running start for the next cycle, and even this year's Congressional and local elections.

# What are we doing?

This is a GitHub repository containing several Markdown (`.md`) files.  The file `common.md` will list of common qualifications
that *all* political leaders should have at every level, including local.  Specific files, such as `president.md` will list qualifications
specific to that level.

Each file should be a list, with one point per line.

You are encouraged to fork this repository and send me pull requests with your ideas. Discsusions surrounding the merits
of submitted ideas should happen in pull requests.

*IMPORTANT*: We're aiming for _general_ qualifications that any sound-minded American should be able to agree on. We're
_not_ looking for partisan points here.  If you submit something that contains something like "must be a staunch conservative"
or "must be a bleeding-heart liberal", you're completely missing the point.  We're looking for character and experience qualifications,
not ideology.  In fact I would suggest that someone who meets the qualifications that we list, but has an opposite ideology from you,
is probably vastly preferable to someone who has similar ideology but lacks many of these qualifications.
